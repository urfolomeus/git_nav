# Git Nav

## Sat Nav for gits ... not really

Git Nav is a simple tool for moving forwards and backwards (currently in steps)
through a given git repo. It is currently very much alpha and was just knocked
together in order to help with a presentation.

Highlights to follow: -

* Handle branching and merge commits
* Add an interactive mode (I've already coded this as it was the first approach I took)
* Give the code a damn good refactoring

I'm planning a blog post to explain why I did this rather than just use the command line
(HINT: going back through a repo history is easy with ~ and ^ but going fowards is not ...
as far as I currently am aware)

Any questions etc. email to alan at edgecase dot com
